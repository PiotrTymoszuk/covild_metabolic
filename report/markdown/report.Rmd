# Methods

## Analysis software

The study data set was handled and analyzed with R version 4.2.0. 
Handling and transformation of tabular data was accomplished by the packages _tidyverse_ [@Wickham2019], _rlang_ [@Henry2022] and the development package _trafo_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/trafo). 
Text data were handled (search, extraction, replacement) with _stringi_ [@Gagolewski2021]. 
For descriptive statistic, correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing, the packages _rstatix_ [@Kassambara2021] and _ExDA_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/ExDA) were employed. 
Ordinal logistic modeling and model diagnostic was done with _MASS_ [@Ripley2022], _broom_ [@Robinson2014], _caret_ [@Kuhn2008] and the development packages _lmqc_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/lmqc) and _caretExtra_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/caretExtra).

Results were visualized with the packages _ggplot_ [@Wickham2016], _ExDA_ and _cowplot_ [@Wilke2019]. 
Tables were created with _flextable_ [@Gohel2022]. 
Parts of the manuscript and supplementary material were written in the _rmarkdown_ environment [@Allaire2022]. 
Tables and figures were handled (insertion and reference) with the development package _figur_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/figur). 
Text parts were rendered as Word and PDF documents with _bookdown_ [@Xie2016] and _knitr_ [@Xie2022].

## Variable transformation

Participants were dichotomized according to the age cutoff of 60 years. 
Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) > 25 $kg/m^2$, obesity as BMI > 30 $kg/m^2$. 
Dyslipidemia was defined with triglycerides (TG) > 150 mg/dL or low high density lipoprotein (HDL, < 40 mg/dL for males or HDL < 50 mg/dL females). 
Dysglycemia was defined as HbA1c â‰¥ 5.7%. 
Participants were classified according to acute COVID-19 severity as mild (WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement: 1 - 2), 
moderate (WHO: 3 - 4) and severe (WHO: $\geq$ 5). 
Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, > 0.5 mg/dL), interleukin 6 (IL6, > 7 pg/mL) and TG (> 150 mg/dL) were defined with standard cutoffs. 
Chest CT abnormalities were classified as none (CT severity score [CTSS]: 0), mild (CTSS: 1 - 5), moderate (CTSS: 6 - 10) and severe (CTSS: $\geq$ 11) [@Luger2022]. 
Some variables were in addition transformed with the log function to improve normality and homogeneity of variances as described below. 
The full list of study variables with stratification scheme and levels in the entire cohort and COVID-19 severity strata is provided in __Table \@ref(tab:tab-cohort)__.

## Explorative data analysis, normality and variance homogeneity testing

Descriptive statistic of the study variables and differences between the COVID-19 severity strata were investigated with the _ExDA_ and _rstatix_ [@Kassambara2021] packages. 
Differences in categorical variables between the COVID-19 severity strata were assessed by $\chi^2$ test with Cramer V effect size statistic. 
Differences in numeric variables between the COVID-19 severity strata were investigated by Kruskal-Wallis test with $\eta^2$ effect size statistic. 

Normality of numeric variable distribution in groups defined by age class and COVID-19 severity or dyslipidemia/dysglycemia status and follow-up was assessed with Shapiro-Wilk test. 
Homogeneity of variances in these strata was investigated by Levene test. 
Distribution testing was performed with _ExDA_ and _rstatix_ [@Kassambara2021].
D-dimer (DDimer), ferritin (FT), HDL, adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and leptin (LEP) concentrations were log-transformed to improve normality prior to modeling. 
IL6, CRP and TG were dichotomized with the cutoffs described above to meet the ordinal logistic regression assumptions.

## Correlation and time course analyis

Pair-wise association of non-transformed levels of metabolic (TG, HDL, ADIPOQ, LEP) and inflammatory bio-markers (CRP, IL6, DDimer, FT) was analyzed by Spearman's correlation (package _ExDA_). 

Changes in non-transformed levels of inflammatory and metabolic bio-markers between consecutive follow-ups in participant strata defined by the dyslipidemia and dysglycemia status were investigated by Friedman test with Kendall's W effect size statistic (_rstatix_) [@Kassambara2021]. 
Differences between the strata at specific follow-ups were assessed by Holm-corrected Mann-Whitney U post-hoc test (_ExDA_). 

## Ordinal logistic modeling

Classes of chest CT abnormality were defined as described above. 
Effects of inflammatory bio-markers (CRP, IL6, DDimer, FT), metabolic parameters (TG, HDL, ADIPOQ, LEP) and metabolic disorders (obesity, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia) on severity of chest CT abnormalities at the 60-day follow-up were investigated by ordinal logistic modeling (package _MASS_) [@Ripley2022]. 
Three types of models were constructed for each explanatory variable: (1) uni-variable models, (2) models including age class and sex as confounders, and (3) models including age class, sex and acute COVID-19 severity as confounders (package _lmqc_). 
The confounders selected for analysis are canonical risk factors of persistent chest CT abnormality (__Figure \@ref(fig:fig-confounder-V0)__, __Table \@ref(tab:tab-conf-models)__ and __\@ref(tab:tab-conf-models)__). 
Normality and homogeneity of variance of the model residuals were assessed by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively (packages _lmqc_ and _broom_) [@Robinson2014]. 
Proportionality of odds was gauged by Brant test (package _brant_) [@Brant1990; @Schlegel2022]. 
Metrics of classification performance of the models (classification error, Cohen's $\kappa$ and confusion matrix) were computed with the _caret_ package tools [@Kuhn2008] (__Table \@ref(tab:tab-explanatory-fit)__). 
Finally, model coefficient estimates expressed as odds ratios (OR) and their confidence intervals were extracted. 
OR significance (OR $\neq$ 1) was determined by two-tailed T test (__Table \@ref(tab:tab-explanatory)__). 

Multi-parameter modeling of chest CT abnormality severity was done by ordinal logistic regression with Akaike information criterion (AIC) driven backwards elimination of non-significant terms as described by us recently in the COVILD study data set [@Luger2022]. 
Briefly, full models including age class, sex, acute COVID-19 severity, CRP, IL6, DDimer, FT, TG, HDL, ADIPOQ, LEP, obesity, dyslipidemia and dysglycemia at the 60-day follow-up were constructed. 
The full models were subsequently optimized by backwards elimination (function `stepAIC()`, package _MASS_) [@Ripley2022]. 
Assumptions of the model residuals distributions, classification performance and inference were analyzed as described above. 
Reproducibility and proper parameterization of the models was investigated with cross-validation (10-fold, 50 repeats, packages _caret_ and _caretExtra_) [@Kuhn2008]. 
As demonstrated in __Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fit-stats)__, comparable classification errors and $\kappa$ accuracy statistics of the models in the training data set and cross-validation suggest that none of the multi-paramater models suffered from overfitting.
